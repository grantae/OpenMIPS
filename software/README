README for MIPS32r1 Cache/TLB Software
======================================

This directory contains software tests, utilities, and instructions
for building a gcc-based cross-compiler toolchain. It supports the
entire design flow from C source code to running on real hardware.


Directory Organization
----------------------
    README:         This README file.
    gcc-mips/:      Instructions for building a cross-compiler toolchain.
    regdiff/:       A utility to find the differences in architectural state
                    between two execution dumps. This is useful for pinpointing
                    where a failing test diverges. This utility is used in
                    conjunction with the 'make rtrace_<test_name>' targets for
                    the macro testsuite.
    util/:          Utilities for generating BRAM initialization data.
